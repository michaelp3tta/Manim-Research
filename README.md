# Manim-Research
WXML Research Spring 2025


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a set of interactive 3D animations and supplemental materials designed to enhance the teaching of university-level calculus. Built using the Manim CE Python library and custom 3D print designs, the animations illustrate advanced concepts such as arc length and multivariable calculus in an intuitive, visual format. The project integrates research-driven insights with collaborative development, resulting in high-quality videos and physical models that provide students with engaging and accessible ways to explore complex mathematical ideas.
